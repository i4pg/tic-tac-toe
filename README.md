<h1>Tic Tac Toe</h1>
<p>This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe. It is part of the curriculum for The Odin Project's
  JavaScript course.</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<p>You can play the game online <a href="https://i4pg.github.io/tic-tac-toe/" target="_new">here</a>.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Two players can play the game (X and O).</li>
  <li>Players can take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.</li>
  <li>The game ends when a player gets three in a row or all spaces are filled without a winner.</li>
  <li>The winner is displayed at the end of the game.</li>
  <li>The game keeps running and calculating points.</li>
  <li>It supports single player so you can play against a computer.</li>
  <li>The computer uses a simple algorithm that takes all the available moves, then loops twice. First, it tries each
    move and plays it if it's a winning move; otherwise, it goes to the next move. Second, if there is no winning move,
    it tries each possible move and plays there if it's preventing the opponent from winning; otherwise, it chooses a
    random place to play.</li>
  <li>It has a mobile-first responsive design, using <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_new">Bulma.io</a>.</li>
</ul>
